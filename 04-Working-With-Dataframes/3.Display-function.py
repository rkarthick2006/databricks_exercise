# MAGIC ##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) Getting Started
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Run the following cell to configure our "classroom."

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run "./Includes/Classroom-Setup"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Prepare the data source.

# COMMAND ----------

(source, sasEntity, sasToken) = getAzureDataSource()

spark.conf.set(sasEntity, sasToken)

# COMMAND ----------

path = source + "/wikipedia/pagecounts/staging_parquet_en_only_clean/"
files = dbutils.fs.ls(path)
display(files)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC As we can see from the files listed above, this data is stored in <a href="https://parquet.apache.org" target="_blank">Parquet</a> files which can be read in a single command, the result of which will be a `DataFrame`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Create the DataFrame. This is the same one we created in the previous two notebooks.

# COMMAND ----------

parquetDir = source + "/wikipedia/pagecounts/staging_parquet_en_only_clean/"

# COMMAND ----------

pagecountsEnAllDF = (spark  # Our SparkSession & Entry Point
  .read                     # Our DataFrameReader
  .parquet(parquetDir)      # Returns an instance of DataFrame
)
print(pagecountsEnAllDF)    # Python hack to see the data type

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) show(..)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC What we want to look for next is a function that will allow us to print the data to the console.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In the API docs for `DataFrame`/`Dataset` find the docs for the `show(..)` command(s).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In the case of Python, we have one method with two optional parameters.<br/>
# MAGIC In the case of Scala, we have several overloaded methods.<br/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In either case, the `show(..)` method effectively has two optional parameters:
# MAGIC * **n**: The number of records to print to the console, the default being 20.
# MAGIC * **truncate**: If true, columns wider than 20 characters will be truncated, where the default is true.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Let's take a look at the data in our `DataFrame` with the `show()` command:

# COMMAND ----------

pagecountsEnAllDF.show()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC In the cell above, change the parameters of the show command to:
# MAGIC * print only the first five records
# MAGIC * disable truncation
# MAGIC * print only the first ten records and disable truncation
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Note:** The function `show(..)` is an **action** which triggers a job.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) display(..)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The `show(..)` command is part of the core Spark API and simply prints the results to the console.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Our notebooks have a slightly more elegant alternative.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Instead of calling `show(..)` on an existing `DataFrame` we can instead pass our `DataFrame` to the `display(..)` command:

# COMMAND ----------

display(pagecountsEnAllDF)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### show(..) vs display(..)
# MAGIC * `show(..)` is part of core spark - `display(..)` is specific to our notebooks.
# MAGIC * `show(..)` is ugly - `display(..)` is pretty.
# MAGIC * `show(..)` has parameters for truncating both columns and rows - `display(..)` does not.
# MAGIC * `show(..)` is a function of the `DataFrame`/`Dataset` class - `display(..)` works with a number of different objects.
# MAGIC * `display(..)` is more powerful - with it, you can...
# MAGIC   * Download the results as CSV
# MAGIC   * Render line charts, bar chart & other graphs, maps and more.
# MAGIC   * See up to 1000 records at a time.
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC For the most part, the difference between the two is going to come down to preference.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Like `DataFrame.show(..)`, `display(..)` is an **action** which triggers a job.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) limit(..)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Both `show(..)` and `display(..)` are **actions** that trigger jobs (though in slightly different ways).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC If you recall, `show(..)` has a parameter to control how many records are printed but, `display(..)` does not.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We can address that difference with our first transformation, `limit(..)`.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC If you look at the API docs, `limit(..)` is described like this:
# MAGIC > Returns a new Dataset by taking the first n rows...
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC `show(..)`, like many actions, does not return anything. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC On the other hand, transformations like `limit(..)` return a **new** `DataFrame`:

# COMMAND ----------

limitedDF = pagecountsEnAllDF.limit(5) # "limit" the number of records to the first 5

limitedDF # Python hack to force printing of the data type

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Nothing Happened
# MAGIC * Notice how "nothing" happened - that is no job was triggered.
# MAGIC * This is because we are simply defining the second step in our transformations.
# MAGIC   0. Read in the parquet file (represented by **pagecountsEnAllDF**).
# MAGIC   0. Limit those records to just the first 5 (represented by **limitedDF**).
# MAGIC * It's not until we induce an action that a job is triggered and the data is processed
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We can induce a job by calling either the `show(..)` or the `display(..)` actions:

# COMMAND ----------

limitedDF.show(100, False) #show up to 100 records and don't truncate the columns

# COMMAND ----------

display(limitedDF) # defaults to the first 1000 records

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) select(..)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Let's say, for the sake of argument, that we don't want to look at all the data:

# COMMAND ----------

pagecountsEnAllDF.printSchema()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC For example, it was asserted above that **bytes_served** had nothing but zeros in it and consequently is of no value to us.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC If that is the case, we can disregard it by selecting only the three columns that we want:

# COMMAND ----------

# Transform the data by selecting only three columns
onlyThreeDF = (pagecountsEnAllDF
  .select("project", "article", "requests") # Our 2nd transformation (4 >> 3 columns)
)
# Now let's take a look at what the schema looks like
onlyThreeDF.printSchema()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Again, notice how the call to `select(..)` does not trigger a job.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC That's because `select(..)` is a transformation. It's just one more step in a long list of transformations.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Let's go ahead and invoke the action `show(..)` and take a look at the result.

# COMMAND ----------

# And lastly, show the first five records which should exclude the bytes_served column.
onlyThreeDF.show(5, False)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The `select(..)` command is one of the most powerful and most commonly used transformations. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We will see plenty of other examples of its usage as we progress.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC If you look at the API docs, `select(..)` is described like this:
# MAGIC > Returns a new Dataset by computing the given Column expression for each element.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The "Column expression" referred to there is where the true power of this operation shows up. Again, we will go deeper on these later.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Just like `limit(..)`, `select(..)` 
# MAGIC * does not trigger a job
# MAGIC * returns a new `DataFrame`
# MAGIC * simply defines the next transformation in a sequence of transformations.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) drop(..)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As a quick side note, you will quickly discover there are a lot of ways to accomplish the same task.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Take the transformation `drop(..)` for example - instead of selecting everything we wanted, `drop(..)` allows us to specify the columns we don't want.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC If you look at the API docs, `drop(..)` is described like this:
# MAGIC > Returns a new Dataset with a column dropped.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC And we can see that we can produce the same result as the last exercise this way:

# COMMAND ----------

# Transform the data by selecting only three columns
droppedDF = (pagecountsEnAllDF
  .drop("bytes_served") # Our second transformation after the initial read (4 columns down to 3)
)
# Now let's take a look at what the schema looks like
droppedDF.printSchema()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Again, `drop(..)` is just one more transformation - that is no job is triggered.

# COMMAND ----------

# And lastly, show the first five records which should exclude the bytes_served column.
droppedDF.show(5, False)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) distinct() & dropDuplicates()
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC These two transformations do the same thing. In fact, they are aliases for one another.
# MAGIC * You can see this by looking at the source code for these two methods
# MAGIC * ```def distinct(): Dataset[T] = dropDuplicates()```
# MAGIC * See <a href="https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.scala" target="_blank">Dataset.scala</a>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The difference between them has everything to do with the programmer and their perspective.
# MAGIC * The name **distinct** will resonate with developers, analyst and DB admins with a background in SQL.
# MAGIC * The name **dropDuplicates** will resonate with developers that have a background or experience in functional programming.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As you become more familiar with the various APIs, you will see this pattern reassert itself.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The designers of the API are trying to make the API as approachable as possible for multiple target audiences.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC If you look at the API docs, both `distinct(..)` and `dropDuplicates(..)` are described like this:
# MAGIC > Returns a new Dataset that contains only the unique rows from this Dataset....
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC With this transformation, we can now tackle our first business question:

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### How many different English Wikimedia projects saw traffic during that hour?

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC If you recall, our original `DataFrame` has this schema:

# COMMAND ----------

pagecountsEnAllDF.printSchema()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The transformation `distinct()` is applied to the row as a whole - data in the **project**, **article** and **requests** column will effect this evaluation.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC To get the distinct list of projects, and only projects, we need to reduce the number of columns to just the one column, **project**. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We can do this with the `select(..)` transformation and then we can introduce the `distinct()` transformation.

# COMMAND ----------

distinctDF = (pagecountsEnAllDF     # Our original DataFrame from spark.read.parquet(..)
  .select("project")                # Drop all columns except the "project" column
  .distinct()                       # Reduce the set of all records to just the distinct column.
)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Just to reinforce, we have three transformations:
# MAGIC 0. Read the data (now represented by `pagecountsEnAllDF`)
# MAGIC 0. Select just the one column
# MAGIC 0. Reduce the records to a distinct set
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC No job is triggered until we perform an action like `show(..)`:

# COMMAND ----------

# There will not be more than 100 projects
distinctDF.show(100, False)               

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC You can count those if you like.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC But, it would be easier to ask the `DataFrame` for the `count()`:

# COMMAND ----------

total = distinctDF.count()     
print("Distinct Projects: {0:,}".format( total ))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) dropDuplicates(columns...)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The method `dropDuplicates(..)` has a second variant that accepts one or more columns.
# MAGIC * The distinction is not performed across the entire record unlike `distinct()` or even `dropDuplicates()`.
# MAGIC * The distinction is based only on the specified columns.
# MAGIC * This allows us to keep all the original columns in our `DataFrame`.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Our code is spread out over many cells which can make this a little hard to follow.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Let's take a look at the same code in a single cell.

# COMMAND ----------

parquetDir = source + "/wikipedia/pagecounts/staging_parquet_en_only_clean/"

# COMMAND ----------

pagecountsEnAllDF = (spark       # Our SparkSession & Entry Point
  .read                          # Our DataFrameReader
  .parquet(parquetDir)           # Returns an instance of DataFrame
)
(pagecountsEnAllDF               # Only if we are running multiple queries
  .cache()                       # mark the DataFrame as cachable
  .count()                       # materialize the cache
)
distinctDF = (pagecountsEnAllDF  # Our original DataFrame from spark.read.parquet(..)
  .select("project")             # Drop all columns except the "project" column
  .distinct()                    # Reduce the set of all records to just the distinct column.

# MAGIC ##![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) DataFrames vs SQL & Temporary Views
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The `DataFrame`s API is built upon an SQL engine.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As such we can "convert" a `DataFrame` into a temporary view (or table) and then use it in "standard" SQL.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Let's start by creating a temporary view from a previous `DataFrame`.

# COMMAND ----------

pagecountsEnAllDF.createOrReplaceTempView("pagecounts")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Now that we have a temporary view (or table) we can start expressing our queries and transformations in SQL:

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC SELECT * FROM pagecounts

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC And we can just as easily express in SQL the distinct list of projects, and just because we can, we'll sort that list:

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC SELECT DISTINCT project FROM pagecounts ORDER BY project

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC And converting from SQL back to a `DataFrame` is just as easy:

# COMMAND ----------

tableDF = spark.sql("SELECT DISTINCT project FROM pagecounts ORDER BY project")
display(tableDF)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
